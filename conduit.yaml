routing:
  # Default optimization strategy
  # Options: balanced, quality, cost, speed
  default_optimization: balanced

  # Reward weight presets for routing decisions
  # Each preset balances quality, cost, and latency differently
  # Weights must sum to 1.0
  presets:
    balanced:
      quality: 0.7    # Prioritize quality
      cost: 0.2       # Moderate cost concern
      latency: 0.1    # Low latency concern

    quality:
      quality: 0.8    # Maximize quality
      cost: 0.1       # Minimal cost concern
      latency: 0.1    # Minimal latency concern

    cost:
      quality: 0.4    # Acceptable quality
      cost: 0.5       # Minimize cost
      latency: 0.1    # Low latency concern

    speed:
      quality: 0.4    # Acceptable quality
      cost: 0.1       # Low cost concern
      latency: 0.5    # Minimize latency
